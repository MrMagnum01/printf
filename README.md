# ALX Software Enginering Team Project : Printf
This repository contains a team project called _printf, a custom-made `printf` function for the C programming language. The function has been optimized to handle various inputs and optional arguments, exactly like the standard library function printf works.

We developed this project as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading. The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of C programming and our ability to implement a widely used and powerful function like `print` from scratch.
